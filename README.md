# example_container_project

A very basic tutorial for using containerised computing in our analyses.

To run this simple example you'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine, and (if you're on Windows or Mac), this will require the Docker Desktop platform to be running.

If you've got git installed on your machine (please do so, but thats a different tutorial...) then you can download this repo by opening your terminal or powershell, moving to the location that you want this folder to go, and using the command `git clone https://github.com/hemprichbennett/example_container_project.git`. If you don't have git installed, you can download a .zip file using the green 'code' button above.
